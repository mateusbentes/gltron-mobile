    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [Insert date]</p>

    <p>GLTron Mobile (“the App”) is an offline game developed as a fan-made fork of the open-source GLTron project. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles user data.</p>

    <h2>1. No Data Collected</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or non-personal data.</p>

    <h2>2. No Internet Access</h2>
    <p>The App operates fully offline and does not connect to the Internet or communicate with any external servers.</p>

    <h2>3. No Permissions Required</h2>
    <p>The App requires no Android permissions and does not access device features such as storage, camera, microphone, contacts, or location.</p>

    <h2>4. No Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not include third-party SDKs such as analytics, advertisements, crash reporting, or social login.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Because no data is collected, the App complies with COPPA, GDPR-K, LGPD, and other child data protection laws.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>Any future changes will be published on this page.</p>
