GLTron Mobile - Multiplatform Android & iOS
==============================================

MonoGame Multiplatform Port (current build path)
================================================
This project now supports both Android and iOS using MonoGame (.NET) with shared codebase and platform-specific builds.

Platform Support:
- ✅ Android: Works on Linux/Windows/macOS
- ✅ iOS: Requires macOS with Xcode and iOS workload

Quick Start:
- Platform detection: ./scripts/detect-platform.sh
- Android build: ./scripts/build-android-app.sh
- iOS build (macOS only): ./scripts/build-ios-app.sh
- Full documentation: README_MULTIPLATFORM.md

Project Structure:
- GltronMobileEngine/: Shared game engine and graphics
- GltronMobileGame/: Android-specific project
- GltronMobileGame.iOS/: iOS-specific project
- Both platforms share the same game logic and content

Legacy Java Android project
===========================
The original Android Java/OpenGL ES implementation remains under GlTron/ for reference only. It is not used by the new build scripts.


INTRODUCTION
============
This project started as an Android port by Iain Churcher to learn Android and OpenGL ES programming, based on glTron version 0.7 by Andreas Umbach (www.gltron.org).

Current Status:
- Evolved into a full multiplatform MonoGame (.NET) implementation
- Supports both Android and iOS with shared C# codebase
- Modern graphics pipeline using MonoGame framework
- Cross-platform content pipeline for assets
- Maintains the original game mechanics and feel

The current MonoGame implementation provides:
- Better performance and maintainability than the original Java port
- True multiplatform support (Android + iOS)
- Shared game engine with platform-specific optimizations
- Modern .NET development experience

Original Java port remains available under GlTron/ for reference.
